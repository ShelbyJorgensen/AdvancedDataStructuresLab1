# AdvancedDataStructuresLab1
This lab was created for my CS302 Advanced Data Structures class at Central Washington University. In this lab, we were asked to complete problems related to Binary Search Trees, both iteratively, and recursively. Below is the provided outline for this lab:

**Problem 1**
Your are given the root nodes of two binary search trees. Determine if both trees store the same numbers.
Note that the trees do not need to be equivalent in structure; the question is only if they store the same numbers.
Implement an iterative and recursive solution.

**Problem 2**
Your are given the root node of a binary search tree T and two integers min and max. Note that min and max are
not necessarily stored in the tree. Determine the sum of all keys stored in T that are larger than or equal to min,
and smaller than or equal to max. Implement an iterative and recursive solution.
